TASK:
x) Replace STD functions.
x) Add more styling/components.
x) Animation API.
x) FIX: Weird issues when dragging.
x) Default themes

BUGS:
-VSync causes a lot of problems with the inputs. For example, when dragging the
|graphics can run {-NumOfBackBuffers} frames behind the mouse causing a weird thing
|where the object being dragged doesn't feel good. Disabling V-Sync fixes all of this,
|but it's not a good solution to force on the user.
